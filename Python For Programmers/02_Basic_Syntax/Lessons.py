#Lesson One:       Program Structure
    #Hello World
        # The notorous hello world program can be written in Python as follows:
print('Hello World!')
    #The main() Function
def main():
    print('Hello World!')
        # The main function defines the starting point of the program and including
        #  main() allows us to import and run the program in other scripts.
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
        # The if statement checks whether the program is being run independently as
        #  the primary module or as a library in another script.
    #Examples
def main():
    print('New World!')
    newFunction()

def newFunction():
    print('Second Output')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
