SQL Manipulation Project

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to assess your understanding of basic SQL commands
covered in this lesson including CREATE TABLE, INSERT INTO, SELECT, ALTER TABLE, UPDATE, and DELETE.

Instructions:

1) Create a new database called 'RevenueDB'

2) Create the following tables with appropriate columns and constraints:

        DepositID:      An integer that must use the primary constraint.
        Player:         A text value that can not be null.
        Deposit_Amount: An integer value that can not be null.
        Date:           A text value that can be null.

3) Insert the following sample data into both tables.
DepositID,  Player,            Deposit_Amount, Date
0,         'Bowen Higgins',    500,            3/23/24
1,         'Franklin Sierra',  750,            3/24/24
2,         'Marceline Avila',  100,            3/24/24
3,         'Olivia Palmer',    2000,           3/24/24
4,         'Liam Nisan',       3000,           3/25/24
5,         'Marceline Avila',  500,            3/25/24
6,         'Kaleb Gentry',     300,            3/25/24

4) Perform the following tasks:
    4a) Retrieve all entries in the deposit table.
    4b) Retrieve the names of players who made a deposit on 03/24/24.
    4c) Retrieve the deposit amounts of players who made a deposit on 03/24/24.

    4d) Update the deposit amount of the player with the DepositID 3 to 1000.
    4e) Update the deposit date of the player with the DepositID 1 to 3/24/24.
    
    4f) Insert a new record into the deposits table with the player name set to 'Robert Pat', deposit amount '500', and deposit date 3/25/24.
    4g) Add a new column called 'Deposit_Time' and autofill each entry with the time '12:00AM'.

    4h) Delete the deposit with DepositID 2 from the Deposits table;
    4i) Delete the column called 'Deposit_Time'.
    
    4j) Retrieve the details of the remaining deposits.

Submission:
    Submit a text file containing:
    1) SQL script for creating the database, table, and inserting sample data.
    2) SQL queries for performing the tasks mentioned above.
