What is SQLite?
    SQLite is a database engine that allows users to interact with a relational database. SQLite stores
    the database in a single file which allows for a great deal of portability as databases can be copied
    and used locally.

Drawbacks to SQLite
    The use of a single file is also a limiting factor when using SQLite as only 1 user can modify the file
    at a time to maintain the integrety of the data. Futhermore, SQLite does not support all the capabilities
    of other SQL databases such as stored procedures or triggers. Lastly, SQLite does not validate data types
    that is, SQLite will not reject values of the wrong type and as a result accidently insert  the wrong data
    types in the columns. While SQLite allows the storage of different datatypes in the same column, this is a
    bad habit that can lead to errors so its best to avoid it.

Uses for SQLite
    Despite the drawbacks, the benefits of a serverless database are huge. SQLite is used worldwide for testing,
    development, and any senerio where it makes sense for the database to be on the same disk as the application
    code.
