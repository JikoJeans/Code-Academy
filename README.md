# Code Academy Practice Repository
Welcome to my Code Academy practice repository! Here, I'll be storing courses started and problems that I solve, starting with SQL possibly other languages as time continues.

## Python For Programmers
This course acts as an introduction to the basic syntax and fundamentals of Python for experienced programmers by bypassing the basics of coding.
Each folder contains 1 section that holds a file for the code and notes from each lesson called lessons.db and any other correlating content.

### Section 1: Getting Started With Python
